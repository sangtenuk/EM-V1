# Real-Time Gallery Implementation

## Overview
The gallery system has been enhanced with real-time functionality using Supabase real-time subscriptions. When new photos are uploaded, they appear immediately in both the admin gallery view and the public upload interface.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Admin Gallery (EventGallery.tsx)
- **Real-time subscriptions**: Automatically receives updates when photos are added, deleted, or modified
- **Visual indicators**: Shows "Live updates enabled" status with animated green dot
- **New photo highlighting**: Newly uploaded photos are highlighted with green glow and larger scale
- **Toast notifications**: Shows success messages when new photos are uploaded
- **Automatic photo list updates**: Photos are added to the beginning of the list in real-time

### 2. Public Gallery Upload (GalleryUpload.tsx)
- **Live gallery view**: Users can toggle to see all uploaded photos in real-time
- **Real-time updates**: New photos appear immediately when uploaded by others
- **Visual feedback**: New photos are highlighted with green ring and scale animation
- **Photo counter**: Shows total number of photos in the gallery
- **Attendee names**: Displays who uploaded each photo

## Technical Implementation

### Real-Time Subscriptions
```typescript
const subscription = supabase
  .channel(`gallery_photos_${eventId}`)
  .on(
    'postgres_changes',
    {
      event: '*',
      schema: 'public',
      table: 'gallery_photos',
      filter: `event_id=eq.${eventId}`
    },
    (payload) => {
      // Handle INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE events
    }
  )
  .subscribe()
```

### Event Handling
- **INSERT**: New photos are added to the beginning of the list
- **DELETE**: Photos are removed from the list
- **UPDATE**: Photos are updated in place

### Visual Indicators
- Animated green dots for live status
- Green glow effect on new photos
- Scale animations for new photo highlighting
- Toast notifications for user feedback

## Usage

### For Admins
1. Navigate to `/admin/gallery`
2. Select an event
3. Watch as new photos appear in real-time
4. Use the slideshow feature to display photos during events

### For Attendees
1. Scan the gallery QR code or visit `/public/gallery/:eventId`
2. Upload photos using the upload form
3. Toggle "View Gallery" to see all photos in real-time
4. Watch as new photos from other attendees appear immediately

## Benefits
- **Immediate feedback**: Users see their uploads instantly
- **Engagement**: Real-time updates encourage more participation
- **Event atmosphere**: Live gallery creates excitement during events
- **No manual refresh**: No need to refresh the page to see new content

## Browser Compatibility
- Works with all modern browsers that support WebSocket connections
- Gracefully degrades if real-time connection fails
- Maintains functionality even without real-time updates

## Performance Considerations
- Subscriptions are automatically cleaned up when components unmount
- Photos are cached locally to reduce database queries
- Efficient updates only modify changed data
- Connection is event-specific to avoid unnecessary subscriptions
